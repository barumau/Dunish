# Ideas of Dunish

## Principles of Dunish

Dunish is _evenly global_.
It borrows words from from all regions and all cultures of the world.
It is the world language that stands for the whole world!

Dunish is _practical_.
It re-uses things that have already become international, including
the basic Latin alphabet,
basic words from English, and
international words from Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Chinese and Arabic.
That way Dunish can be used in real international communication right from the start.

Dunish is _simple_.
In international situations it is best to use plain words, short sentences and simple language
because they are much more effective than specialized words, long sentences and complex language.
So, let's keep it simple!

Dunish feels _real_.
It is like a lost relative of English
that seems to be of the same kind as English and – at the same time – noticeably of its own kind.
In this regard it is similar to the real relatives of English
(like German, Dutch, Afrikaans and the Scandinavian languages)
and the children of English,
(like Jamaican, Singaporean and Nigerian versions of English).
