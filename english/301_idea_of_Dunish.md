# Ideas of Dunish

## Principles of Dunish

Dunish is _evenly global_.
It borrows words from from all regions and all cultures of the world.
It is the world language that stands for the whole world!

Dunish is _practical_.
It re-uses things that have already become international, including
the basic Latin alphabet,
basic words from English, and
international words from Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Chinese and Arabic.
That way Dunish can be used in real international communication right from the start.

Dunish is _simple_.
In international situations it is best to use plain words, short sentences and simple language
because they are much more effective than specialized words, long sentences and complex language.
So, let's keep it simple!

Dunish feels _real_.
It is like a lost relative of English
that seems to be of the same kind as English and – at the same time – noticeably of its own kind.
In this regard it is similar to the real relatives of English
(like German, Dutch, Afrikaans and the Scandinavian languages)
and the children of English,
(like Jamaican, Singaporean and Nigerian versions of English).


## Evenly global

About 6500 languages are spoken in the world.
Some languages are spoken by a lot of people in many different countries
while others are spoken by only a few people in one geographic area.

When native speakers of different langauges are added together going from the largest to the smalles language,
the sum grows quickly at first
but the growth gets slower and slower
and finally it's hardly noticeable.

For example, when only native speakers are counted in,

- 25 percent of the world population speaks the top-3 languages,
- 50 percent of the world speaks the top-12 languages,
- 75 percent of the world speaks the top-50 languages,
- 85 percent of the world speaks the top-100 languages,
- and finally 100 percent of the world speaks about 6500 languages.

## Useful in real life

Dunish is meant to be a useful language in real life.
What does it mean?
It means that you can speak it immediately in hotels, shops, taxis, airports, train stations, etc...
It means that you can understand road signs and signboards of hotels, bars and restaurants.
It means that you can make yourself understood.

Dunish is open.
You are allowed to use words from other languages in Dunish.
Use whatever is necessary to make yourself understood!
You may say, for example, **mi wan gou do "fan dien"** in China,
even though **restoran** is the normal word for restaurant in Dunish.
It's more important to get to the restaurant than to speak perfect Dunish, isn't it?

Dunish is not a secret language for a small club or a cult.
It's more important to be able to communicate with everybody in practice
than to protect "the purity of our language" on paper.



## What Dunish should sound like?

Dunish is spoken in the "continental" manner.
It means that the Germanic part of Dunish sounds rather like German, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages,
and the Romance part sounds like Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.

German: Nation /natsio:n/
Dutch: natie /na:tsi/
Russian: нация /natsiya/
French: nation /nasyõ/
Spanish: nación /nasyon/
Portuguese: nação /nasãũ/

## Minimalism?

One of the goals of Dunish is to have less words to be memorized than English and other natural languages,
but it's not meant to be minimal.
