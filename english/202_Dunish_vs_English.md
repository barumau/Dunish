## Spelling

The English spelling is one of the hardest spellings in the world.
It is complicated and often illogical.
The same letter can represent different sounds in different words
or, in case of silent letters, no sound at all!
You don't say what you see.

There are many reasons for the chaotic state of the English spelling:

- The 26 letters of the English alphabet are simply not enough to represent around 36 sounds of the spoken language.
- Various invaders (Vikings, Romans and Normans) wanted to spell English in their own way.
- The spelling did not keep up with the changes in the spoken language.
  Many words are still spelled the same way as in the Middle Ages.
- English has borrowed words from many languages – and it has kept their original spelling!

There are too many irregularities to be listed here.
A few rhymes are enough to show what's the matter:
one - won, two - too - to, four - for - fore, eight - ate - great.
For more examples, read [The Chaos](http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html), a poem by Gerard Nolst Trenité.

Dunish, on the other hand, is a regular language.
Each letter (or combination of letters) is pronounced in the same way in every word.
If you hear a word, you can always spell it.
If you read a word, you can always pronounce it.

In addition, the Dunish spelling is more or less compatible with most of the other languages in the world
that are written in the Latin alphabet.
The following table lists letters that are pronounced similarly in Dunish and other languages.
