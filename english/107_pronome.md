## Personal pronouns

The personal pronouns in Dunish are:

| Person | Singular             | Plural             |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|
| First  | **mi** (_I_)         | **wi** (_we_)      |
| Second | **tu** (_you_)       | **yu** (_you all_) |
| Third  | **he** (_he or she_) | **ze** (_they_)    |

The personal pronouns are gender-neutral in Dunish.
We don't differentiate the sexes in any of the pronouns.
So the third person singular pronoun **he** means both _him_ and _her_ (or _he_ and _she_).

In the second person, it's acceptable to use the plural pronoun **yu** always
instead of the singular pronoun **tu**.


## Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns are made simply by combining a basic pronoun
with the possessive marker **'s**.

| Person | Singular                | Plural               |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| First  | **mi's** (_my_)         | **wi's** (_our_)     |
| Second | **tu's** (_your_)       | **yu's** (_your_)    |
| Third  | **he's** (_his or her_) | **ze's** (_their_)   |


## Interrogative pronouns

**wa** what  
**hu** who  
**hu's** whose


## Demonstrative pronouns

**da** that, those
