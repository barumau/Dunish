# Spelling and pronunciation

Dunish is fully phonetic two directions:

1. When you hear a word, you can always spell it.
2. When you read a word, you can always pronounce it.

## Basic Latin Alphabet

Dunish is written in the basic Latin alphabet (the same as English).
It doesn't have any of the accented letters, which are different from language to language.
So it can be typed, printed and used with computers and smart devices in most countries without any difficulty.

## Additional Sounds

There are also additional letters and letter-combinations, which can be used only in _local words_
like names of places and people.
They are not used in any ordinary Dunish words.

| Dunish | IPA  | Pronunciation advise |
|:------:|:----:|:---------------------|
| Kh     | /x/  | Voiceless velar fricative, like _ch_ in _Loch_ in Scottish. |
| Gh     | /ɣ/  | Voiced velar fricative |
| Ph     | /ɸ/  | Voiceless bilabial fricative |
| Bh     | /β/  | Voiced bilabial fricative |
| Q      | /q/  | Voiceless uvular stop |
| Qh     | /χ/  | Voiceless uvular fricative |
| Rh     |/ʀ~ʁ/ | Voiced uvular trill or fricative like _rh_ in _rhume_ in Parisian French. |
| Th     | /θ/  | Like _th_ in _thing_. |
| Dh     | /ð/  | Like _th_ in _they_. |
| Zh     | /ʒ/  | Like _z_ in _azure_. |

The additional letters and digraphs are used locally.
Their purpose is to help to transfer names in the local language to the international language,
so that the local people can recognize them.
It's OK if you don't know how to pronounce any of these sounds.
Just pronounce the first letter and ignore the H.

For example, the capital of Greece is called "Αθήνα" /aθina/ in the local language, Greek.
The Dunish version of this name is "Athina".
It can be pronounced in the same way
We want to preserve the sound of this word as much as possible,
but we can't use any of the non-Latin letters,
so it becomes "Athina" in Dunish.


Examples:  
**Athina** Athens (the capital of Greece)  
**Khartum** Khartoum (the capital of Sudan)  
**Rhone** Rhône (a river in France and Switzerland)  
**Rhein** Rhine (a river that flows through Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Germany, France and the Netherlands)
