# Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Dunish.
They don't change in person, number and time like in English.
Verbs are not conjugated at all.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by a personal pronoun or a noun.

**mi love tu.**
– I love you.  
**wi love yu.**
– We love you.  
**he love tu.**
– He or she loves you.  
**Jorje is love Mari.**
– George loves Mary.  
**tri siste is love un man.**
– Three sisters love one man.

## Time

Dunish does not have grammatical markers for tense i.e. a verb's position in time (past, present, or future).
Ordinary expressions of time,
such as **laste dei** (yesterday), **neste dei** (tomorrow), and **nau** (now),
can be used for telling when exactly something happened.

Dunish does have grammatical words for expressing temporal aspects.
Aspects describe how an event can be viewed in relation to other events in time.

- The progressive aspect (**is**) indicates an event that is ongoing.
- The perfect aspects
    - The resultative aspect (**has**) indicates a completed event whose results have an effect on the present situation.
    - The experiential aspect (**don**) indicates a completed event that has no connection to the present situation.
- The future aspect (**wil**) indicates a situation that hasn't taken place yet.

The figure below illustrates how the different aspects relate to the time under discussion i.e. the "present time" in the narrative.

### Progressive aspect

The progressive aspect indicates that an event is ongoing ("in progress") and incomplete at the time under consideration.
It is marked with **is** before the verb.

**Sara is vide de TV.**
– Sara is watching the TV.  
**wi is vizite yu's lande.**
– We are visiting your land.

Note: Normally **is** can be used instead of **is bi**.

**Sara is mi's frende.**
– Sarah is my friend.  
**wi is in London.**
– We are in London.


### Experiential aspect

The experiential aspect describes a completed past situation that is not linked to a later time.
It is marked with **don** before the verb.

– My mother visited Canada three times (but she won't go there anymore).  
**mi don luze mi's chabi laste dei**
– I lost my keys yesterday (but I found them).  
**Juli has bi mi's frende fo ten yer.**
– Julie has been my friend for ten years. (And she still is.)


### Resultative aspect

The resultative aspect describes a completed past situation whose consequences are relevant to the time under discussion.
It is marked with **has** before the verb.

**mi has nou Juli fo ten yer.**
– I have known Julie for ten years. (I still know her).  
**he has vizite de Kanada tri ves.**
– He has visited Canada three times. (He could go there again).

It is marked with **wil** before the verb.

**wi wil toke de Dunish.**
– We will speak Dunish.  
**mi wil bi yu's frende.**
– I will be your friend.

## To be

The verb **bi** (to be) is used mostly like in English.
It is a regular verb with one exception:
**is** is normally used instead of **is bi**.

Naturally, there is only one form that is used in all persons.

**mi is hapi.**
– I am happy.  
**wi is hapi.**
– We are happy.  
**tu is hapi.**
– You are happy. (singular)  
**yu is hapi.**
– You are happy. (plural)  
**he is hapi.**
– He or she is happy.  
**ze is hapi.**
– They are happy.

The aspect markers can be used with **bi** just like with other verbs.

**he don bi un bebe.**
– He was a baby.  
**he has bi un boi.**
– He has been a boy.  
**he wil bi un man.**
– He will be a man.
