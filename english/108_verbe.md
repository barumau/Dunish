# Verbs

## Time

Dunish does not have grammatical markers for tense i.e. a verb's position in time (past, present, or future).
Ordinary expressions of time,
such as **laste dei** (yesterday), **neste dei** (tomorrow), and **nau** (now),
can be used for telling when exactly something happened.

Dunish does have grammatical words for expressing temporal aspects.
Aspects describe how an event can be viewed in relation to other events in time.

- The progressive aspect (**is**) indicates an event that is ongoing.
- The perfect aspects
    - The resultative aspect (**has**) indicates a completed event whose results have an effect on the present situation.
    - The experiential aspect (**don**) indicates a completed event that has no connection to the present situation.
- The future aspect (**wil**) indicates a situation that hasn't taken place yet.

The figure below illustrates how the different aspects relate to the time under discussion i.e. the "present time" in the narrative.
