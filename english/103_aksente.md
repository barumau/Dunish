# Accent

The accent or stress falls on the first or the second syllable depending on the length of the base word.

If the base word has one or two syllables, the first syllable is accented, and secondary accent falls on odd-numbered syllables.
Ex. kómun, kómunìte.

If the base word has three or more syllables, the second syllable is accented, and secondary accent falls on even-numbered syllables.
Ex. matúre, matúritè.

When there is **i** or **u** and another vowel, the two vowels count as one syllable.
Ex. páuze, dúnia, rádio, Rúsia, Arábia, Itália.

The elements of compound words keep their original accent.
Ex. télefóne, kílográme.

Accented syllables are louder in general.
If the accented syllable ends in a vowel, the vowel is pronounced longer.

Unaccented **e** can be pronounced as a weak schwa sound /ə/.
Ex. toke /tókə/, mature /matúrə/.
