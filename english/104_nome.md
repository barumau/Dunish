# Nouns

A noun is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things,
such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.

Nouns are unchanging in Dunish.
The same form of the word is used regardless of number and definiteness.
Number, definiteness and other categories are expressed by separate words.


## Number

In Dunish, nouns are the same in all numbers.
Nouns don't change to indicate is there one (i.e. singular) or many (i.e. plural)
instances of the thing that the noun refers to.
So it's not like English where the singular and the plural of nouns are usually different:
one _man_ but many _men_, one _ox_ but many _oxen_, one _cat_ but many _cats_.
Rather, all Dunish words are like the word "sheep" is in English,
which you count one sheep, two sheep, three sheep, etc.

In Dunish, the number of things is indicated with number words and other quantity words.

**un haus**
– one house or a house  
**due haus**
– two houses  
**tri haus**
– three houses  
**for haus**
– four houses

All number words can be found in the [chapter about numerals](105_numer.md).

Common words for indicating plurality include **som** (_some_), **meni** (_many_) and **muce** (_much, a lot_).

**som haus**
– some houses  
**meni haus**
– many houses  
**muce haus**
– a lot of houses


## Definite and indefinite articles

Definite articles, like "the" in English, are used
when we are referring to a specific thing or something that has been mentioned before.
Indefinite articles, like "a" and "an" in English,
refer to a non-specific thing or something that has not been mentioned before.

If you know what you want, you just use a definite article,
and if you don’t know what you want, you use an indefinite article.

### Indefinite articles

There are two indefinite articles in Dunish,
**un** is used when we refer to _one_ non-specific thing,
and **som** is used when we refer to _many_ things.

**un apel**
– an apple  
**som apel**
– some apples

**un haus**
– a house  
**som haus**
– some houses

### Definite articles

There are two definite articles in Dunish,
**da** is used when we refer to _one_ specific thing,
and **di** is used when we refer to _many_ things.

**da man**
– the man  
**di man**
– the men

**da haus**
– the house  
**di haus**
– the houses
