## What is Dunish?

Dunish is a simple language that helps people to talk with each other
when they don't have any other common language.

All words in Dunish are international.
The basic words are similar to English
and the rest come from other important languages,
including French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi and Swahili.

Dunish is compatible with English on a basic level.
It's like a simplified version of English that is spoken with a foreign accent.

to get a hotel room, to order a taxi, to buy souvenirs and to do many other things.

Dunish is much easier to learn than English or any other national language because it is regular and simple.
There aren't unnecessary rules that you just have to know.
Everybody can learn Dunish to a good level in a short period of time!
Dunish is an excellent choice for the international language because it improves the quality of communication.

## Basics of Dunish

<p style="font-size:5em;">🧱</p>

Dunish is written in the English/Latin alphabet:  
a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p r s t u v w x y z  
Only two letters are pronounced different than in English:
**x** = SH as in _ship_ and
**c** = CH as in _church_.

All the vowels are pure vowels.
The letter **e** is pronounced as the central vowel /ə/ in unaccented syllables.

Only the lower-case letters are in use in Dunish.

The spelling of Dunish is almost phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stressed syllable is the first one in short words and the second one in longer words.  
**méni pípe kán tóke da énglix in amérika.**

Words stay always the same in Dunish.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
**mi love yu.**
– I love you.

<p style="font-size:5em;">💑</p>

The word order is the same also in questions.  
**yu love mi, wa?**
– You love me, eh? (i.e. Do you love me?)

Singular and plurals are indicated with number words.  
**un buke**
– (one) book;
**do buke**
– two books;
**tri buke**
– three books;
**meni buke**
– many books

<p style="font-size:5em;">📕📚</p>

Comparison is done with helping words:
**mor**
– more;
**les**

**sam**
– equally.  
**yu is mor gude dan mi.**
– You are better (_more good_) than me.  
**he toke mor faste dan yu.**
– He or she talks faster (_more fast_) than you.

Time is expressed with helping verbs:
**bin**
– did;
**has**
– has done;
**dos**
– does; and
**wil**
– will do.  
**he has ride meni buke.**
– He or she has read many books.  
**mi dos ride un buke.**
– I am reading one book.  
**wi wil toke dunix.**
– We will talk Dunish.

A sentence-final particle expresses why the sentence is said,
i.e. is the sentence supposed to be for example a statement, a question or a command.  
**yu love da kafe, wa?**
– You love coffee, eh? (question)  
**yu love da kafe, ye.**
– You love coffee, indeed. (statement)  
**yu love da kafe, or...**
