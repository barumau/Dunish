## Modal particles

[Modal particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_particle)
indicate how the speaker thinks that the content of the sentence relates to the participants' common knowledge
or add mood to the meaning of the sentence.


The word **wa** is used to turn a declarative sentence into a question.

**yu wan yam som piza.**
– You want to eat pizza.  
**yu wan yam som pizza, wa?**
– Do you want to eat pizza?

Another way to tag a question is to add the word **no** at the end of a sentence.
The **no** can represent any English question tag, so depending on context it will translate as:
"isn't it?", "aren't they?", "can't she?", "wouldn't they?", etc.

**yu wan yam som pizza, no?**
– You want to eat pizza, don't you?

**ye**
indicates that the speaker thinks a certain fact should already be known to the listener.

**mi love yu, ye!**
– I do love you!

The word **or** indicates uncertainty.
It is used when the speaker wants to be reassured.

**yu love mi, or...**
– You love me, or...
