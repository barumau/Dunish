# Word Derivation

Forming a new word from an existing word is called word derivation.
Often a new word is formed by adding a prefix or suffix, such as _un-_ or _-ness_.
For example, _unhappy_ and _happiness_ derive from the root word _happy_.

## Zero Derivation

Zero derivation means conversion of a word of a certain word class to a different word class without any change in form.
In Dunish, this is very common.
In fact, most words don't belong to any fixed word classes.
Instead, the word class is determined by the word's place in the sentence.

For example, the word **blanke** can function equally as an adjective (_blank_ or _void_), noun (_a blank_) and verb (_to make blank_ or _to get blank_).

**yu have som blanke papir, no?**
– Do you have some blank paper?  
**give mi un blanke!**
– Give me a blank!  
**yu mus blanke da texte.**
– You must blank out the text.

Likewise, the word **skribe** can function as a verb (_to write_), a noun (_a writing_) and adjective (_written_ or _textual_).

**mi skribe un letre.**
– I write a letter.  
**un letre is un skribe misaje.**
– A letter is a written message.  
**mi love yu's skribe.**
– I love your writings.


## Compound Words

Words can be combined freely in Dunish to express new concepts.
The last element in the combination is the main one in determining the meaning,
while the preceding element only modifies the meaning.

For example, **eskribe meza** means a type of table (a writing table).
Similarly,
**kristal klare**
= crystal-clear,
**love lete**
= love letter,
**kafe kupe**
= coffeecup.

Compound words may be written together or separately.
Especially established compound words are usually written together.
For example, the word for _democracy_ is more commonly **demekratie** than **deme kratie**.


## Affixation

Prefixes and suffixes are very important and give great flexibility to the language.

but most are true prefixes or suffixes and can be used only as such, not as separate words.
