# Word Building

## Compound Words

Compound words may be formed freely.
The last element in the combination is the main one in determining the meaning,
while the preceding element only modifies the meaning.

For example, **eskribe meza** means a type of table (a writing table).
Similarly,
**vide punte**
= viewpoint or point of view,
**kristal klare**
= crystal-clear,
**love lete**
= love letter,
**cai kupe**
= teacup.

Nouns can be used as such like they were also adjectives, as is often the case also in English.

Compound words – especially established ones – are frequently written together.
For example, the word for _democracy_ is more commonly **demekrati** than **deme krati**.
